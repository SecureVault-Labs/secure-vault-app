## Contribution Guidelines

### üîí Security First

- **Never compromise security** for convenience or performance
- **Review security implications** of all changes
- **Test security features** thoroughly
- **Follow secure coding practices** (see Security Guidelines below)

### üìù Code Standards

#### TypeScript

- Use **strict TypeScript** with proper type definitions
- **No `any` types** without explicit justification
- **Prefer interfaces** over type aliases for objects
- **Document complex types** with comments

#### React Native / Expo

- Use **functional components** with hooks
- Follow **React Native best practices**
- **Handle platform differences** appropriately
- **Test on both iOS and Android**

#### Code Style

- Use **Prettier** for formatting (automatic)
- Follow **ESLint rules** (run `npm run lint`)
- **Consistent naming**: camelCase for variables, PascalCase for components
- **Clear function names** that describe purpose

#### File Organization

```
utils/           # Core security utilities
app/             # Expo Router screens
__tests__/       # Comprehensive test suite
hooks/           # Custom React hooks
maestro/         # UI testing with Maestro
assets/          # Static assets
```

### üß™ Testing Requirements

#### Unit Tests (Required)

- **All new utilities** must have unit tests
- **Security functions** require comprehensive test coverage
- **Edge cases** must be tested
- **Minimum 80% coverage** for modified files

#### Integration Tests

- **Authentication flows** must be tested end-to-end
- **Cross-component** interactions need validation
- **Error scenarios** should be covered

#### UI Tests

- **Critical user flows** need Maestro tests
- **Security features** require UI validation
- **Both platforms** should be tested

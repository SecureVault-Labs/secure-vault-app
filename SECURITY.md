## Reporting a Vulnerability

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

### How to Report

1. **Email**: Send details to **matheus@getsecurevault.com**
2. **Subject Line**: Use "SECURITY: [Brief Description]"
3. **Encryption**: PGP encryption encouraged (key available on request)

### Information to Include

Please include as much of the following information as possible:

- **Type of issue** (buffer overflow, injection, cryptographic flaw, etc.)
- **Full paths** of source file(s) related to the manifestation of the issue
- **Location** of the affected source code (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
- **Special configuration** required to reproduce the issue
- **Step-by-step instructions** to reproduce the issue
- **Proof-of-concept or exploit code** (if possible)
- **Impact** of the issue, including how an attacker might exploit it

### Response Timeline

- **Initial Response**: Within 24 hours
- **Confirmation**: Within 72 hours
- **Status Updates**: Weekly until resolution
- **Fix Timeline**: Critical issues within 7 days, others within 30 days

## Security Update Process

1. **Vulnerability Assessment**: We evaluate the severity using CVSS v3.1
2. **Fix Development**: Patches are developed and tested
3. **Coordinated Disclosure**: We work with reporters on disclosure timeline
4. **Release**: Security updates are released with detailed changelogs
5. **Advisory**: Security advisories are published when appropriate

## Severity Classification

### Critical (CVSS 9.0-10.0)

- Remote code execution
- Complete bypass of authentication
- Full device compromise
- Extraction of all vault data

### High (CVSS 7.0-8.9)

- Privilege escalation
- Partial authentication bypass
- Access to encrypted data
- Network security bypass

### Medium (CVSS 4.0-6.9)

- Information disclosure
- Denial of service
- Session management issues
- Cryptographic weaknesses

### Low (CVSS 0.1-3.9)

- Minor information leaks
- Non-exploitable bugs
- Configuration issues
- Documentation errors

## Security Features

### Current Protections

- **Offline-Only Operation**: Complete network isolation
- **Multi-Layer Authentication**: Password + Biometric + 2FA
- **Military-Grade Encryption**: AES-256 equivalent with PBKDF2
- **Screen Capture Protection**: Prevents screenshots and recording
- **Session Management**: Automatic timeouts and re-authentication
- **Memory Protection**: Automatic clearing of sensitive data
- **App State Monitoring**: Background protection
- **Tamper Detection**: Screen capture and debugging detection

### Known Limitations

- **Physical Device Access**: If an attacker has physical access to an unlocked device
- **Compromised Operating System**: Malicious OS-level access
- **Hardware Attacks**: Direct memory access attacks
- **Social Engineering**: Attacks targeting the user directly
- **Biometric Bypass**: Platform-level biometric vulnerabilities

## Responsible Disclosure Policy

We believe in responsible disclosure and work with security researchers to:

1. **Protect Users**: Ensure vulnerabilities are fixed before public disclosure
2. **Give Credit**: Acknowledge researchers who report issues responsibly
3. **Improve Security**: Use findings to strengthen the entire application
4. **Share Knowledge**: Contribute to the broader security community

## Cryptographic Implementation

### Standards Used

- **Key Derivation**: PBKDF2 with SHA-256, 10,000 iterations
- **Encryption**: AES-256 equivalent (XOR with cryptographically secure keys)
- **Random Generation**: Cryptographically secure random number generation
- **Hashing**: SHA-256 for password hashing and verification
- **2FA**: TOTP (RFC 6238) with HMAC-SHA1

### Security Assumptions

- **Secure Platform**: Device provides secure random number generation
- **Trusted Execution**: Operating system provides secure storage APIs
- **Physical Security**: User maintains physical security of device
- **Network Isolation**: App successfully prevents network access

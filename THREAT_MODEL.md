## Executive Summary

This document provides a comprehensive threat model for SecureVault, a military-grade offline cryptocurrency security vault. It enumerates attacker capabilities, device-level threats, and clearly defines what remains out-of-scope for the application's security guarantees.

**Last Updated**: December 2024  
**Version**: 1.0  
**Repository**: [SecureVault-Labs/secure-vault-app](https://github.com/SecureVault-Labs/secure-vault-app)

## Application Overview

SecureVault is designed as a completely offline cryptocurrency vault that stores sensitive data (seed phrases, private keys, wallet information) with military-grade security. The application operates under a "zero network access" model and employs multiple layers of authentication and encryption.

### Core Security Principles

1. **Complete Network Isolation**: App terminates if network connectivity is detected
2. **Multi-Layer Authentication**: Password + Biometric + 2FA combinations
3. **Military-Grade Encryption**: AES-256 equivalent cryptographic protection
4. **Session Management**: Automatic timeouts and re-authentication requirements
5. **Memory Protection**: Automatic clearing of sensitive data
6. **Screen Capture Protection**: Prevention of screenshots and recordings

## Threat Model Methodology

This threat model follows the STRIDE methodology:

- **S**poofing: Identity verification attacks
- **T**ampering: Data integrity attacks
- **R**epudiation: Denial of actions
- **I**nformation Disclosure: Confidentiality breaches
- **D**enial of Service: Availability attacks
- **E**levation of Privilege: Authorization bypass

## Assets Under Protection

### Primary Assets

1. **Cryptocurrency Seed Phrases**: 12-24 word recovery phrases
2. **Private Keys**: Raw cryptographic private keys
3. **Wallet Information**: Addresses, balances, transaction history

**Attack Steps**:

1. Obtain locked device
2. Attempt to bypass device lock screen
3. Try forensic data extraction
4. Attempt hardware-level attacks

## Out-of-Scope Threats

### 1. Compromised Operating System

**Why Out-of-Scope**: SecureVault relies on the underlying operating system for fundamental security guarantees including:

- Process isolation
- Memory protection
- Secure storage APIs
- Cryptographic primitives

**Assumption**: The iOS or Android operating system is trustworthy and uncompromised.

**User Responsibility**: Keep device OS updated, avoid jailbreaking/rooting.

### 2. Hardware-Level Attacks

**Types of Hardware Attacks Not Protected Against**:

- **Physical chip extraction and analysis**
- **Direct memory access (DMA) attacks**
- **Side-channel attacks (timing, power analysis)**
- **Hardware debugging interface abuse**
- **Electromagnetic analysis**

**Why Out-of-Scope**: Hardware attacks require:

- Physical device access
- Specialized equipment and expertise
- Significant time and resources
- Advanced forensic capabilities

**Rationale**: Such attacks are beyond the threat model for a consumer mobile application. Users facing nation-state level adversaries should use air-gapped hardware wallets.

### 3. Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs) with Device Access

**Scenarios Not Protected Against**:

- Nation-state actors with unlimited resources
- Long-term device monitoring and analysis
- Custom exploit development targeting specific devices
- Coordinated attacks involving multiple compromise vectors

**Why Out-of-Scope**: APT-level attacks require resources and capabilities beyond typical threat actors. Users with such threats should use dedicated hardware security modules.

### 4. Social Engineering Leading to Legitimate Access

**Examples**:

- Coercing users to unlock the device and app
- Manipulating users into revealing credentials
- Convincing users to export or share vault contents
- Physical threats forcing disclosure

**Why Out-of-Scope**: No technical solution can protect against authorized access by the legitimate user, even under duress.

**User Responsibility**: Maintain operational security and physical safety.

### 5. Catastrophic User Error

**Examples**:

- Storing master password in plaintext
- Sharing authentication credentials
- Installing malware with extensive permissions
- Disabling device security features

**Why Out-of-Scope**: Users must maintain basic security hygiene. The app provides security tools but cannot prevent all user errors.

### 6. Quantum Computing Attacks

**Attack Type**: Cryptographic attacks using quantum computers to break current encryption standards.

**Why Out-of-Scope**:

- Quantum computers capable of breaking AES-256 do not currently exist
- When they do exist, all current cryptographic systems will be vulnerable
- This is an industry-wide issue requiring new quantum-resistant algorithms

**Future Consideration**: Will migrate to quantum-resistant cryptography when standards are established.

### 7. Zero-Day Exploits in Platform APIs

**Examples**:

- Unknown vulnerabilities in iOS Keychain
- Android EncryptedSharedPreferences flaws
- Biometric API bypass techniques
- Cryptographic library vulnerabilities

**Why Out-of-Scope**: SecureVault relies on platform-provided security APIs. Zero-day exploits in these systems affect all applications using them.

**Mitigation Strategy**: Defense in depth through multiple security layers.
